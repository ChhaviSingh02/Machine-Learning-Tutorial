------------------------------------
Day 1: Some Youtube Video's Summary

1. Do a linear regression model based project (eg : predicting grades of a student)

2. A clustering algorithm project(eg : use k nearest means to predict the safety of a  car)

3. Make a project to classify a cancer cell as benign or malignant.

4. use a neural network to classify digits of MNIST dataset.

Note
Read things from books, or if you are going to use video lectures, watch andrew ng and at the same time try to refer to books. It will take time when you will learn from books, but the level of understanding will be better as compared to video lectures
